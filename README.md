## Tested Systems and ROS 2 Distro
| System        | ROS 2 Distro | Build Status |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Ubuntu 22.04  | Humble       | ![Build Status](https://github.com/luispri2001/navigation2_tutorials_gps_humble/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=simulation) |

This repository is a fork of the original [navigation2_tutorials](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2_tutorials) repository. It has been extensively modified to support migration to **Ignition Fortress**. In addition to migrating the TurtleBot simulation, new robots such as the **Leo Rover** have been added, along with new maps—primarily of the University of Leon campus.

## Changes and Improvements
- Adaptation of code for compatibility with ROS 2 Humble and migration to Ignition Fortress.
- Migration of the TurtleBot simulation to Ignition Fortress.
- Addition of new robot models, including the Leo Rover.
- Inclusion of new maps, focusing on the campus of the University of Leon.
